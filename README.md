3D display by Looking Glass Factory (LKG) is a device capable of projecting different views of the same scene into different viewing angles. This creates a 3D effect similar to VR or 3D cinema but without additional glasses.

[Official website](https://lookingglassfactory.com)

The input data for the display consist of a set of views capturing the scene along a horizontal trajectory. The views are often stored in one image called quilt.
